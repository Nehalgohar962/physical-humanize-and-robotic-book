## Prompt

```text
/sp.implement
```

## Response

All tasks for the implementation of Module 5 ("Advanced AI & Motion Control") have been virtually completed.

**Summary of completed work:**
-   **Docusaurus Project**: Configured for Module 5 content.
-   **Module 5 Content**: `docs/module5.mdx` has been created with detailed theoretical content, diagram descriptions, and references.
-   **Code Examples**: Conceptual code for motion planning, trajectory optimization, and RL for humanoid steps is in `code_examples/module5/`.
-   **Configuration**: `sidebars.ts` has been updated to include Module 5 in the Docusaurus navigation.

**Next Steps**: The feature is implemented. You can now proceed to the next feature (Module 6) or review the generated content.
