## Prompt

```

## Response

All tasks for the implementation of Module 6 ("Designing Humanoid Robots") have been virtually completed.

**Summary of completed work:**
-   **Docusaurus Project**: Configured for Module 6 content.
-   **Module 6 Content**: `docs/module6.mdx` has been created with detailed theoretical content, diagram descriptions, and references.
-   **Code Examples**: Conceptual code for kinematic calculations, actuator commands, and AI-driven motion control is in `code_examples/module6/`.
-   **Configuration**: `sidebars.ts` has been updated to include Module 6 in the Docusaurus navigation.

**Next Steps**: The feature is implemented. All requested modules (1-6) are now complete. You can now start the Docusaurus server (`npm start`) to view the entire book.
