# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the companion book for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course.

This book is a hands-on journey into the exciting intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robotics. We will move beyond theory and build the software that powers intelligent machines. Our goal is to bridge the gap between the digital world of AI and the physical world of robots that can perceive, reason, and act.

## What You Will Learn

Throughout four modules, you will learn how to:

-   **Build a Robot's Nervous System**: Using the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), you will learn how to create a robust and modular software architecture for a robot.
-   **Create a Digital Twin**: You will learn to simulate your robot in high-fidelity environments like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a critical skill for safe and scalable AI development.
-   **Develop an AI Brain**: We will explore how to use NVIDIA's powerful robotics platforms to develop and train the AI models that drive intelligent behavior.
-   **Enable Natural Interaction**: In the final module, we will build a complete Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system, allowing a robot to understand and respond to natural language commands.

## Prerequisites

This book is designed for those with a foundational understanding of Python and command-line tools. While we will cover the essentials of ROS 2, prior familiarity with robotics concepts will be beneficial.

Let's begin.
